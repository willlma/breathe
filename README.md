A web extension to delay loading of certain distracting websites

## Installation

Clone this repo, then follow instructions on how to load local extensions on [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/#manifest) and [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing)<sup>1</sup>.

## How to use it
Add websites you'd rather not waste your time on to `manifest.json`'s `matches` item (using wildcards if you'd like to ignore entire domains), then reload the extension.

## Notes
1. You'll need to use Firefox Developer Edition to keep the extension installed permanently.
